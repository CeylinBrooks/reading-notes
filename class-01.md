script is a series of instructions that a
computer can follow to achieve a goal.

To write a script, you need to first
state your goal and then list the
tasks that need to be completed in
order to achieve it.

Browsers come with a set of built-in objects that represent things like the
browser window and the current web page shown in that window. These
built-in objects act like a toolkit for creating interactive web pages.

These built-in objects help you get a wide range
of information such as the width of the browser
window, the content of the main heading in the page,
or the length of text a user entered into a form fie ld.
