# Git Tutorial

**Fetching** entails pulling data that you don’t have from a remote project.
To push your changes “upstream” for sharing, you would use the following git push command format:
git push [remote-name][branch-name]
For file pushing; git push origin master

Rename

To rename a remote’s short name, use the git remote rename command.

You can use the –amend command when you need to alter a commit message or forgot to add some files.

$ git commit --amend

By running the git remote command, you can view the short names, such as “origin,” of all specified remote handles.
